  <h1>About Neil Andrew Lemons</h1>

  <p>For the past 20 years, I have helped companies increase their visibility, drive traffic from search engines, and create meaningful experiences for their customers. Along the way I have provided consulting and SEO/SEM work for than 100 small and medium-sized businesses, which gave me experience that spans both global brands and local startups.</p>

  <p>I began creating and publishing content in the form of a personal blog in 2002. By 2005 I had expanded into SEO and SEM, and for many years I focused on launching websites, teaming up with designers, programmers, writers, and marketers to bring projects to life. Managing millions in Google Ads spend gave me a strong grounding in performance marketing, while keeping storytelling at the center of everything.</p>

  <p>So much of that work revolved around searchingâ€”searching for keyword opportunities, domains, and market gaps. Only later did I realize how similar this was to searching intellectual property (IP) databases for trademarks, copyrighted works, and patents. Both are about understanding what is already claimed, what space remains open, and where real opportunities exist.</p>

  <p>I spent the first decade of my career in digital marketing and web development agencies, where I learned to adapt quickly and deliver results. At the same time I freelanced across dozens of industries, which gave me a broad perspective on how businesses grow in very different environments. After ten years I moved in-house, where I could focus on longer-term strategies, deeper storytelling, and global-scale campaigns.</p>

  <p>Since 2017 I have specialized in cybersecurity marketing, which has kept me close to the cutting edge of technology. In 2023 I began working with AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), using AI and large language models to generate, edit, and curate content.</p>

  <p>The rapid rise of AI caused me to step back and reconsider where I can bring the most lasting value. That reflection led me into the world of intellectual property (IP). I am now preparing to become a registered patent agent and eventually an IP attorney. My mission is to help startups and innovators protect their ideas so they can focus on building with confidence.</p>

  <p>I once dreamed of being a digital nomad, but when my corporate job made that possible in 2020 I discovered that what I wanted most was stability, family, and meaningful work. Today I live east of Dallas with my wife and children in a historic home, where I balance the peace needed to think deeply with the technology that keeps me connected to a fast-changing world.</p>
