  <h1>Patent Search US</h1>
  This website is not a government site. Here is the official U.S. registered patent application and search <a href=https://www.uspto.gov/>website</a>.</p>
  <div style="border:1px solid #ccc; background:#f9f9f9; padding:20px; margin:40px 0; font-size:0.95em; line-height:1.6;">
  <strong>Disclaimer:</strong>
  <p>We are in the process of becoming certified as a registered patent agent. Until then, our services are educational and informational only. Our goal is to soon assist individuals, startups, and businesses of all sizes with protecting and registering their patents.</p>

  <p>While we bring a bachelorâ€™s degree, more than half of an MBA program, and 20 years of experience in technology and marketing, the U.S. government requires anyone who wishes to practice before the USPTO to pass the patent bar. To qualify for that exam, a candidate must complete a set number of accredited science courses. That is the step we are focused on right now.</p>
