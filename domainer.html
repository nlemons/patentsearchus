  <article>
    <h2 id="c64">First Machine: The Commodore 64 (1989–1991)</h2>
    <p>In 1989, my dad bought my brother and me a Commodore 64. It was the first computer we could call our own. I remember in 1990 or 1991 flipping through a brochure about modems and being amazed that people could connect with others around the world. Even before I was building websites, I had a sense that computers were more than machines. They were portals.</p>

    <h2 id="aol">First Exposure: AOL and the Family Computer (1996)</h2>
    <p>In 1996, my parents got AOL. Like most teenagers at that time, I spent time in chatrooms and running searches. But I was not yet building. At home, the internet lived on the family computer, which also doubled as my father’s photography studio workstation for Adobe Photoshop. My time online was limited and shared, and part of me longed for something of my own.</p>

    <h2 id="geocities">First Freedom: Discovering Geocities (1998)</h2>
    <p>That changed in 1998, when I stumbled onto Geocities websites by Yahoo!. That summer, I was 17 and had been given a full scholarship with room and board to attend a university summer school program in a neighboring city. While other high school students were taking the summer off, I split my time between Psychology 101, Phonetics, and long hours in the computer lab.</p>
    <p>It was the summer before my senior year, and for the first time I was free to explore the internet on my own terms instead of waiting for a turn on the family computer. In the lab, I discovered Geocities, where anyone could build, and the Yahoo! Directory, which opened up endless paths of discovery.</p>
    <p>The thrill was not just surfing the web. It was realizing I could both find and publish content that lived online. That realization lit a spark in me that never went out.</p>

    <h2 id="band">First Publishing Permanence: The Band Site (1998–1999)</h2>
    <p>By 1998 or 1999, my brother and I made a simple AOL webpage for our high school alt rock band and uploaded our professionally recorded songs to a site called Garage Band. Years later, a future girlfriend’s mother stumbled across those tracks. Paradoxically, instead of raising questions, it built trust. It was one of my first lessons in the strange permanence of the web: what you put online can echo back into your life years later in ways you never expect.</p>

    <h2 id="lj">First Social Networking: LiveJournal as a Freshman (1999)</h2>
    <p>By 1999, I was a freshman in college. My roommate had a LiveJournal. At first I had no idea what it was, but I quickly figured out it was a different way to connect with others. Many of the early features like Community Journals were very much like Twitter, only long form. You could follow other journals and receive their updates in a chronological, aggregated feed. You could also add a mood, which was like a pre-emoji, a shorthand way to express how you were feeling without needing to explain it in words.</p>

    <h2 id="domain">First Domain: Planting My Flag (2005)</h2>
    <p>In 2005, at age 24, I bought my first domain. That step felt different. For the first time, I was not just participating in someone else’s platform. I was staking a claim on my own corner of the internet. I even paid a guy $100 to create a 7–8 page static website in just a few hours, based on the images and content I gave him. It was not fancy, but it was mine, and it felt like planting a flag.</p>

    <h2 id="agency">Agency and Entrepreneurship (2006–2008)</h2>
    <p>In March 2006, I joined a boutique digital marketing and web design firm in Uptown Dallas. There I learned SEO, HTML, WordPress, Google Ads, link building, and design principles. Many of us at that agency were also building our own personal branding websites. Around the same time, we all jumped on Twitter and would tweet each other across the office.</p>

    <h2 id="nomad">Half-Baked Nomad Attempts (2009 and 2014)</h2>
    <p>Back in 2008, I realized the digital nomad life was possible. I wanted to work remote, to detach, to escape. For twelve years I carried that dream, imagining myself anywhere with Wi-Fi, free from limits.</p>

    <h2 id="ilid">The Rise and Fall of ILiveInDallas (2009–2016)</h2>
    <p>I became a co-founder of ILiveInDallas. When I started, the site pulled in 2,000 visitors a month. At its peak, it broke 100,000. For nearly eight years, it was my playground for SEO and my backstage pass to Dallas nightlife. When my Instagram with 15,000 followers was hacked, the invitations dried up overnight. That loss felt like the ground shifting beneath me. It reminded me that borrowed platforms can be taken away, and only what you own is safe.</p>

    <h2 id="cyber">Pivot into Cybersecurity (2017)</h2>
    <p>In 2017, I took a job at a cybersecurity company. Security had been my blind spot, and it was time to face it head on.</p>

    <h2 id="faith">A Shift in Place and Spirit (2018)</h2>
    <p>In 2018, I moved from Dallas proper to Las Colinas. That move gave me space to think differently. My mind became clearer, less distracted by the noise I had lived in for years. It was also the year I dedicated my life back to the faith I had been brought up in.</p>

    <h2 id="bigsite">Big Site Launch and Hard Lessons (2019)</h2>
    <p>In 2019, I launched one of my most ambitious projects yet, a 4,000+ page educational site about precious metals. The site was on track for 100,000 visitors a month until it was hacked. That loss was crushing, but it etched a lesson in me forever: growth without protection is fragile.</p>

    <h2 id="remote">Remote Work Becomes Reality (2020)</h2>
    <p>In March 2020, the remote dream finally became real when I was told I could work from home. I have been able to do so ever since. What began as an escape plan to globetrot turned into an undeserved luxury, where I could be with my family during working hours.</p>

    <h2 id="domains">Domains as Assets and Vision for 100 (2020–2025)</h2>
    <p>Fast forward to today. I rent 27 domains. Twelve of them have bonafide content, with more than 120 posts already published. My goal is clear: to own or rent 100 domains, code them from scratch, and host them lean on GitHub, avoiding massive hosting bills as the portfolio grows. Some will fade, others will thrive, and I will see which ones grow into something lasting.</p>

    <h2 id="closing">Closing Thoughts</h2>
    <p>From Geocities to Generative SEO, my path has not been a straight line. It has been a cycle of building, breaking, and rebuilding, each time with sharper tools and deeper conviction. The internet will keep evolving, but legacy comes from what you build, what you own, and what endures after the noise fades.</p>
